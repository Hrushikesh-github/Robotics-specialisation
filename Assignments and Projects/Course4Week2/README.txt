Hi!
I have used the PRM algorithm, to solve the motion planning problem. In my code, I have used 26 nodes(including the start and 
end nodes). I chose 5 neighbours for each node, so that there is a greater possibility that I obtain a solution.
Initially, I tries with 2,3 and 4 neighbours but I could find the solution in very few cases.  
I have written the code in matlab. I have used 2 functions A*search and intersects which I have created.
I have attached those files for your reference.Since I used the random function for sampling, in case you try to run the program
you would get a different solution!
