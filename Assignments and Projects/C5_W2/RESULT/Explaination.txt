I have considered a small rectangular brick on a right angled wedge.Mass of wedge(30 units) is much more than mass of brick(2 units)
The coefficient of friction between ground and wedge is 0.9. very high to ensure no slipping between wedge and ground.
Coefficient of friction between brick and wedge is 0.3 in slipping case and 0.7 in stable case.
The reason why system is unstable at 0.3 is because of the stability of brick.It has mgsin(theta) component along the wedge 
which is more than the frictional force 0.3*normal force.(normal force=mgcos(theta)).Theta is angle of wedge.
But if we increase the coefficient of friction to 0.7,then the friction force is sufficient to oppose the mgsin(theta) component
along the wedge. Note that toppling of brick is implausible because of the normal forces acting on it and the short height
of the brick gives more stability from toppling.
